        Some sources can permit change request / pull request from external entities. As part of the configuration of
        such sources you can configure how to determine if a change request / pull request originates from a trusted
        or untrusted user.

        When enabled, this option will only automatically build a change request / pull request if it originate
        from a trusted user (according to your configuration of the source)
